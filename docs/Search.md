### Swiftype
![Swiftype](https://ooo.0o0.ooo/2016/02/08/56b883cdd2e17.png)

You need to have a [Swiftype](https://swiftype.com/) account before using it in Icarus.

``` yml
swiftype: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

This `install key` can be found at your own engine's install page:

Finally, don't forget to save your swiftype configuration to complete the installation.

### Baidu (Not Recommended)

```yaml
baidu: true
```
And this should do the work.
